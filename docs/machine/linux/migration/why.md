# Fuck Windows

> This whole migration thing is a mostly a joking guide and not the best, but will have actual helpful information in it for people wanting to switch, I plan to write a more professional guide, but this is too fun to work on.

Are you tired of Windows just deciding to black screen on boot? Do you still wanna keep Windows 7 cause 10 is unstable? And since 11 is 10 but with more ads and just better, why did you even update to it? Well, I think it's time you ditch this terrible OS and migrate over to Linux.

## Why should I switch to Linux?

There's multiple reasons to switch to Linux if you're an average PC user.

### Stability

Linux is often more stable compared to Windows. Let's say your preferred Desktop Enviornment `plasma` just decides to crash on load after an update. Depending on how your setup, you could easily revert the update, or if that's not an option, check one of the million support threads across several Linux forums that have detailed fixes and what exactly causes the problem. On Windows if `explorer.exe` doesn't load and your desktop stays black, you better hope that you can revert the update or you're literally SoL.

### Lightweight

Linux is hella light. The Linux kernel is 178MB with all required drivers for any system, while Windows is 5GiB. Idle RAM usage on Windows depends on how much RAM you have. On my 16GB VM, windows uses 3GB of RAM without anything running. My laptop that's running Linux Mint at the moment of writing this, idles around 1GB used. So if you're gonna be leaving home and your old laptop needs to come along, Linux might be what it needs to come back.

The whole OS itself is just lighter. Most Windows installs after debloating and optimizing as much as possible, can be as small as 20GB, and seeing as some budget laptops only ship with a 64GB drive. Linux can range from 2MB-5GB, depending on how much you want on the system, roughly 4.5G for a usable system, which is slightly smaller than the windows kernel on it's own.

### Free

While Windows is technically free if you run an activation script or don't care about a watermark, Linux is free in more than just cost. Linux is Open Source, meaning anyone can look at the source code and make any modifications they want for their own system and don't need it to be done by the maintainers of the kernel. Finding software that you need to pay to use on Linux is very rare, and the ones you do most likely also run on other OS's and it's part of their subscription model.

### No more anti consumer and anti trust issues

Microsoft loves to take the P out of PC whenever it can. Back in 2001 they got sued over [Internet Explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.), and in current day they're doing it again with [Microsoft Edge](https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-just-broke-the-best-way-to-make-chrome-your-default-browser). Combined with the fact that the Operating System you **PAID TO USE** comes with advertisements built in, [sends a shit ton of data to third parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT4vDfA_4NI), and is constantly fighting it's users to use a Microsoft account, it's hostile towards people that just want to use a computer and cares even a shred about their privacy and data.

## I'm convinced, let's do this
