# Torrenting
> This guide is not gonna be a perfect as it's just a way to get people into understanding basic torrenting terms. Also so I don't get fucked by LE, this is for educational purposes and any reference to a piracy site is just an example, so if you're LE, fuck off cunts.


## Basics

### Terms

During this you're gonna see a lot of terms that will not make much sense to people outside of this community. Here's a table of terms that you might see here.

|Term|Description|
|----|------------
|Seeder|Uploader|
|Leecher|Downloader|
|H&R|Hit and Run, person does not seed back to at least a 1.0 ratio|
|Peer|A person in the swarm (group) of seeders/leechers|
|Ratio|You Upload:Download ratio of a torrent, you usually wanna get this to 1.0|
|Public/Private Tracker|A site that index's torrents|
|LE|Law Enforcement|
|Copyright Trolls|Either a hired person or someone from a company sitting in the swarm and logs IPs to send notices to|

### Clients

Aigh so a client is what you'll be using to use .torrent files. There are a lot of options. So let's go over 2 popular and 2 obscure ones that you'll see on trackers. If you feel attacked during this, click [here](https://youtu.be/TYQAod8r-uE) for help.

#### µTorrent
µTorrent is a shit fucking client. This client was great back in the early 2000's. Keyword was "was". The client is now filled with ads and at one point had a fucking crypto miner on it. Usually people just starting out use this client as it's an easy to find by searching "torrnet client" on google.

#### Qbittorrent
Qbit is by far my faorite and most recommended client to use. It's multiplatform, Open Source, has a built in tracker, webUI on Linux, can be installed to servers as a seedbox with qbit-nox, and the list goes on. This client is super fucking light weight, perfect for any use, doesn't sell your data, allows you to make themes, and do your taxes all in the client alone. It's the best thing and you should use this.

#### Aria2c
If I ever fucking see you using this when I'm seeding, I'm just gonna block you. The only time you'd be using this is just to leech and do nothing fucking else. This is a cli based downloading tool that isn't specific to torrents. I like this app and I plan to implement this into one of my scripts in the future, but using this client will make you the least liked peer on the network.

#### BitComet
