# Piracy

**THIS GUIDE IS UNFINISHED! IT'S BEING PUT IN IT'S CURRENT STATE SO I DON'T LOSE IT AGAIN**

!!! warning "Disclaimer"
    This guide is for educational purposes only! Piracy is illegal and you should support small creators and not pirate from them. This guide is also written half as a shit post, half serious. I won't list what part is what.

Do you like watching media in your spare time? Don't you hate that you need a Netflix, Hulu, and like 50 more accounts just to watch whatever the current new trendy show is? Don't you hate the anti consumer practices that [Jedi Survivor](https://twitter.com/Dachsjaeger/status/1651945413585387522) is imposing on PAYING CUSTOMERS? Don't you wish you were in control of what you want, when you want, even without internet? Well do I have the not very legal solution for you, piracy!

## Piracy? What's that?

Let's start with what piracy isn't, piracy isn't stealing, the original content is where it was, piracy is making a copy of paid content without the copyright holders permission. If I sent you a `.wbfs` of "No More Heros 2: Desperate Struggle" for the Nintendo Wii, that would be piracy as you did not pay for that copy of the game, but if I handed you the disk of the game, that wouldn't be, since I no longer have my copy and you have one. No new copies were spawned.

## If it's illegal, why would someone do it?

There's a good list of reasons why people pirate. A few of the major ones are listed below.

### Offline backup/Archive

Some streaming services have a download feature in their apps, but you're limited to whatever qualities they provide, their subtitles, and the downloads expire if you don't go online for a certain amount of time. For gaming, it could be to get better performance, as most DRM (Digital Rights Management) solutions come with [performance hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VpWKwIjwLk).

### Region locked content
> ~~this is also known as racism~~

Region locking is what stops you from putting a Japanese copy of a game into your 3DS, or watching the US version of The Office in Canada whenever it hits the Netflix rotation. The only valid use for it I can see is banning something in a region where content is illegal, but that shit is cringe an unbased.

### Subscription Hell

This idea doesn't try to paint piracy as archival or to make it seem legal or just. This is just to not want to spend $15/mo on 8 different services just to watch the shit you want to watch. The table below shows the costs of legal streaming vs downloading your media.

## This sounds awesome, how can I start?

I see you've decided to sail the seven seas, the next pages will have tools and links to sites to help start your adventures.
