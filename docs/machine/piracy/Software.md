## Torrent client

This one is not the most critical to focus on, but does matter a bit. You want a good torrent client with the features you want/need, and everyones needs are different. The usual recommendations for good clients include [qBittorrent](https://qbittorrent.org), [deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/), and [transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/). Each have their own perks and drawbacks, but that's for other people that actually use all 3 clients to write and not the person that only uses qBit.

### Torrent client config
> This will only follow qBittorrent, as it's the one I use. Any screenshot or torrent client setting recommendation will be qBittorrent only.
